# Simple Text Summarizer

Uses the NLTK library for Machine Learning on language and text aka NLP. 

Quite simply written, this code was custom made by looking at the documentation and does not involve any complex algorithm for the result. 

Most of the lines are explained or described at their side using comments. 

-  Unordered Summarizer extracts the abstract based on word frequency filtering.
- Ordered Summarizer extracts the abstract by using sequential summarizing.



## Requirements:

- **NLTK** for NLP --> Use `pip install nltk` to install.
- **Pandas** for File Operations --> Use `pip install pandas` to install. 



## How to Use:

Make sure the code(.py file) and the data.txt file are in the same directory or else change the path of the file if you require. Refer: [Absolute and Relative path](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001708.htm).

1. Copy and paste the required text to summarize from source to data.txt 
2. Run the code and acquire output. 



### Errors:

None.
